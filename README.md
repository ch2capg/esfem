ESFEM
======================================================================

This the central repository for all of my numerical experiments.  Please
consider [LICENSE.md][3].

I use the [dune][1] v2.3 and [dune-fem][2] v1.4 libraries.  There are reasons
why the newest release is not good for my.

For every paper I have experiments.  For ALE finite elements, for a quasilinear
problem, for maximum norm and for the solution driven problem. 
Esfem::Brusselator_scheme is a good starting point.
